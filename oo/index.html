        In Part III of this class, we will "prototype" an object-oriented programming language using
        a technique known as <i>source-to-source translation</i>.
      </abstract>

          <span>Introduction</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          So far we've seen two common ways to prototype a programming language: as a stand-alone interpreter and as a
          library (or <i>embedded language</i>) in an existing host language. In this part of the class we'll see a
          third common implementation style that involves translating a program in the <i>source language</i> into a
          program in an existing language (the <i>target language</i>) that has the desired behavior. Such a
          <i>source-to-source translation</i> can be viewed as a lightweight form of compilation: rather than
          translating all the way down to machine code, the language implementer gets to leverage the features in a
          high-level target language, which significantly simplifies the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach can also be seen as a middle ground between the two prior approaches we've seen in the class.
          Like with an interpreter, the source language has its own syntax (and requires a parser to convert this
          syntax into some form of abstract syntax trees). Like with an embedded language, it's often possible to
          represent features in the source language directly, using counterparts in the target language. For example, it
          might be possible to translate a function in the source language to a function in the target language that
          has the same behavior, which then allows function calls in the source language to be implemented simply as
          function calls in the target language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, some language features in the source language will not map directly to a semantically-equivalent
          construct in the target language. In that case, the translation has to construct some code in the target
          language that will behave as desired. Depending on the complexity of that code, it may be nicer to factor it
          out to a library so that the target code is as simple and readable as possible. Such a library is similar in
          spirit to the idea of an embedded language that we saw in the previous homework assignment, except that this
          library is meant only for use by the source-to-source translator rather than directly by the programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Part III of this class, you'll "prototype" an object-oriented programming language by translating it to
          JavaScript. In Homework #4, you will write a library that implements the core semantics of classes and
          objects in our source language. In Homework #5, you will write a translator that completes the prototype and
          also add some interesting new features to the language.

          <span>Our OO Language</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          We'll start with a "vanilla" object-oriented language with single inheritance. Our language is
          dynamically-typed, and has Java-like syntax.
        </p>
        <h2>Declaring Classes</h2>
        <p>
          Here's how you declare a new class in our language:
	  <codeBlock>class Point {
  var x, y;
}</codeBlock>
          The <code>Point</code> class in this example has two instance variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
          (Instance variables are declared using the <code>var</code> keyword.)
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, new classes are subclasses of <code>Object</code>, which is the root of the class hierarchy in
          our language. You can optionally specify a superclass in a class declaration using  the <code>extends</code>
          keyword, e.g.,<codeBlock>class ThreeDeePoint extends Point {
  var z;
}</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h2>Declaring Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Our language supports <i>open classes</i>. This means that you can add new methods to a class without
          editing its declaration. In fact, the syntax of our language does not even allow programmers to write methods
          as part of a class declaration. Here's how you add a method called <code>initialize</code> with arguments
          <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to our <code>Point</code> class:<codeBlock>def Point.initialize(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}</codeBlock>
          And here's how you override <code>Point</code>'s <code>initialize</code> method shown above for instances
          of <code>ThreeDeePoint</code>:<codeBlock>def ThreeDeePoint.initialize(x, y, z) {
  super.initialize(x, y);
  this.z = z;
}
</codeBlock>
          <b>Note:</b> In our language, it doesn't matter that <code>ThreeDeePoint</code>'s version of
          <code>initialize</code> takes 3 arguments whereas <code>Point</code>'s <code>initialize</code> method only
          takes two arguments &mdash; the former still overrides the latter. (Our language does not support static
          overloading.)
        </p>
        <h2>Creating Objects</h2>
        <p>
          To create a new instance of a class, you use the <code>new</code> keyword:
          <codeBlock>var p = new Point(1, 2);</codeBlock>
          As part of evaluating a <code>new</code> expression, our language invokes the <code>initialize</code> method
          on the new instance with the arguments supplied. Here's what happens when the expression
          <code>new C(arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code> is evaluated:
          <ul>
            <li>A new instance of <code>C</code> is created;</li>
            <li>The new instance's <code>initialize</code> method is called with the arguments provided, i.e.,
              <code>newInstance.initialize(arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code>;</li>
            <li>The new instance becomes the value of the entire <code>new</code> expression.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Statements and Expressions</h2>
        <p>
          Our language supports typical kinds of statements and expressions that you find in an OO language, most
          importantly the abilities to send a message to an object, access the value of an instance variable of an
          object, and update the value of an instance variable of an object. The <code>initialize</code> methods above
          illustrate assignment to instance variables, for example. These constructs should have the same behavior as
          they do in a typical OO language such as Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          In homework #4, method bodies can additionally employ JavaScript primitive values and associated
          operations, along with control-flow statements like conditionals and loops. In homework #5
          we will see how our source language supports these things (and more!) in an elegant and powerful way.

          <span>Homework #4: A Library for Classes and Objects</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
          <due>
            <b>Due at 11:30pm on Friday, February 20.</b>
            Turn in just your <tt>oo.js</tt> file through the course page on CCLE.
          </due>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this homework assignment, you will implement a library containing the core functionality that will be
          necessary for the translation of our OO language to JavaScript.  This homework assignment has two parts,
          described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Important:</b> Please do your work in a file called <a href="oo.js"><code>oo.js</code></a>. Each time you
          refresh this page, that file is loaded by our test harness to run the unit tests on this page. As in the
          previous homework assignments, you can add your own test cases by editing
          <a href="hw4-tests-part1.js"><code>hw4-tests-part1.js</code></a> and
          <a href="hw4-tests-part2.js"><code>hw4-tests-part2.js</code></a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Part I: The Library</h2>
        <p>
          Your library, which will be accessed via the global variable <code>OO</code>, will maintain a
          <i>class table</i> that maps class names to their associated classes. This means that you will have to come
          up with an appropriate representation of classes. You will also have to decide how to represent
          instances of those classes. Your library must support all of the methods described below:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>initializeCT()</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Initializes the class table. After this method is called, the class table should only contain the
                  <code>Object</code> class, which must support the following methods:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>initialize()</code>, which does nothing.
                    <li><code>=== x</code>, which returns <code>true</code> if the receiver and <code>x</code> are
                      the same object, <code>false</code> otherwise.<br>
                      (This method has the same semantics as JavaScript's <code>===</code> operator.)</li>
                    <li><code>!== x</code>, which returns <code>true</code> if the receiver and <code>x</code> are
                      <b>not</b> the same object, <code>false</code> otherwise.<br>
                      (This method has the same semantics as JavaScript's <code>!==</code> operator.)</li>
                  </ul>
                  (See <code>declareMethod</code> below for more on the representation of methods.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>declareClass(name, superClassName, instVarNames)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Creates a new class with the appropriate name, superclass, and instance variable names, and adds
                  that class to the class table.
                <li>Throws an exception if:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The class table already contains a class with the same name
                      (<i>duplicate class declaration</i>).</li>
                    <li>There is no entry in the class table for <code>superClassName</code>
                      (<i>undeclared class</i>).</li>
                    <li>There are duplicates in <code>instVarNames</code>, or one or more elements of
                      <code>instVarNames</code> are also instance variable names of a (possibly transitive) superclass
                      (<i>duplicate instance variable declaration</i>).</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.declareClass("Point", "Object", ["x", "y"])</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>declareMethod(className, selector, implFn)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Adds a method named <code>selector</code> to the class named <code>className</code>, whose
                  associated method implementation is <code>implFn</code>.</li>
                <li>The implementation function <code>implFn</code> should have <code>_this</code> as its first
                  argument, followed by the formal arguments of the method that is being declared. (When a method
                  is called, <code>_this</code> will be bound to the receiver.) E.g.,
                  <codeBlock>OO.declareMethod("Point", "initialize",
  function(_this, x, y) {
    OO.setInstVar(_this, "x", x);
    OO.setInstVar(_this, "y", y);
  }
);</codeBlock>
and <codeBlock>OO.declareMethod("Point", "+",
  function(_this, that) {
    return OO.instantiate(
      "Point",
      OO.send(OO.getInstVar(_this, "x"), "+", send(that, "getX")),
      OO.send(OO.getInstVar(_this, "y"), "+", send(that, "getY"))
    );
  }
);</codeBlock></li>
                <li>Note that <code>declareMethod</code> can also be used to override a method of the same
                  name in the superclass.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>instantiate(className, arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Creates a new instance of the class named <code>className</code>, calls its <code>initialize</code>
                   method with <code>arg<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>arg<sub>2</sub></code>, &hellip; as arguments, and
                   returns the new instance.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if there is no entry in the class table for <code>className</code>
                  (<i>undeclared class</i>).</li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.instantiate("Point", 1, 2)</code> should evaluate to a new <code>Point</code> whose
                  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> instance variables have been initialized to <code>1</code> and
                  <code>2</code>, respectively. (Assuming that <code>Point.initialize</code> was declared as shown
                  above.)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>send(recv, selector, arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Looks up the method with the name <code>selector</code> in the class of <code>recv</code> (the
                  <i>receiver</i> of the message), calls the method with the appropriate arguments, and returns the
                  result of that call.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if <code>recv</code>'s class does not have such a method
                  (<i>message not understood</i>).</li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.send(OO.instantiate("Point", 1, 2), "+", OO.instantiate("Point", 3, 4))</code> should
                  evaluate to a new <code>Point</code> whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> instance variables are
                  equal to <code>4</code> and <code>6</code>, respectively.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>superSend(superClassName, recv, selector, arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Looks up the method that corresponds to <code>selector</code> in the class called
                  <code>superClassName</code>, calls it with the appropriate arguments, and returns the result of that
                  call.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if:
                  <ul>
                    <li>There is no entry in the class table for <code>superClassName</code>
                      (<i>undeclared class</i>).</li>
                    <li>The superclass does not have such a method (<i>message not understood</i>).</li>
                  </ul></li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.superSend("Object", myPoint, "initialize")</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>getInstVar(recv, instVarName)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Returns the value of the instance variable called <code>instVarName</code> in
                  <code>recv</code>.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if <code>recv</code> does not have an instance variable with that name
                  (<i>undeclared instance variable</i>).</li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.getInstVar(myPoint, "x")</code>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>setInstVar(recv, instVarName, value)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Sets the value of the instance variable called <code>instVarName</code> in <code>recv</code> to
                  <code>value</code> and returns that value.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if <code>recv</code> does not have an instance variable with that name
                  (<i>undeclared instance variable</i>).</li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.setInstVar(myPoint, "x", 5)</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are all of the requirements for your implementation. However, you'll probably want to declare a few
          helper methods to simplify your implementation of the API described above. Here are a couple of ideas to get
          you started:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>getClass(name)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Returns the object that represents the class with the given <code>name</code>.</li>
                <li>Throws an exception if there is no such class (<i>undeclared class</i>).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>classOf(x)</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Returns the object that represents the class of the object <code>x</code>.</li>
                <li>E.g., <code>OO.classOf(OO.instantiate("Point", 1, 2))</code> should evaluate to the object that
                  represents the <code>Point</code> class.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&hellip;</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Part II: Look ma, no primitives!</h2>
        <p>
          In mainstream "object-oriented" languages like Java and C++, primitive values like <code>5</code> and
          <code>true</code> are not real objects. This is unfortunate because (among other things) it often forces
          programmers to write code in an unnatural way. Here are a couple of examples:
          <ul>
            <li>Isn't it annoying that you can write <code>getAge()</code> as a method of <code>Person</code>, but you
              can't write <code>factorial</code> as a method of <code>int</code>?</li>
            <li>Why is it that primitive types like <code>int</code> are not classes?!?! In Java,
              this means that you can't use them as type parameters of a generic class / interface. For example, you
              can't have a <code>Set&lt;int&gt;</code> &mdash; instead, you're stuck with
              <code>Set&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, i.e., a set of <i>boxed</i> <code>int</code>s. Is this really something
              the programmer should have to deal with?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As an aspiring language designer, we hope this lack of uniformity gives you the heebie-jeebies, and we know
          you can do better! It shouldn't matter how an integer is represented at the language implementation level.
          Our job is to help programmers, and we shouldn't expose them to implementation details that make programming
          more complicated than it has to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Homework #5, we will make our language into a "pure" object-oriented language, i.e., a language in which
          <i>everything</i> is an object. As we'll see, this has some really nice benefits for the expressiveness of
          the language. OK, you're clearly excited about this&hellip; Alright then, we won't make you wait until
          Homework #5 to get a taste of the pure stuff :)
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first step toward supporting pure OO programming, modify your implementation of the API described above
          so that JavaScript's primitive numbers can be used as first-class objects in your language. For example,
          <code>OO.send(6, "*", 7)</code> should evaluate to <code>42</code>. Here are the changes you'll have to make:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>OO.initializeCT()</code> should declare the following classes and methods:
              <ul>
              <li>
                <code>Object</code>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>initialize()</code>, <code>===</code>, and <code>!==</code> should work as described
                    previously.</li>
                  <li><code>isNumber()</code> returns <code>false</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>Number</code> (a subclass of <code>Object</code>)
                <ul>
                  <li><code>isNumber()</code> returns <code>true</code></li>
                  <li><code>+ anotherNumber</code> returns the sum of the receiver and <code>anotherNumber</code>
                  <li><code>- anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                  <li><code>* anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                  <li><code>/ anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                  <li><code>% anotherNumber</code> &hellip;
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                When <code>typeof recv === "number"</code>,<br>
                <code>OO.send(recv, selector, arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;)</code> should look up the
                method with the name <code>selector</code> in the <code>Number</code> class.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </p>
